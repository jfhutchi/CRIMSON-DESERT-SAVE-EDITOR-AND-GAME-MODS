# Crimson Desert — Save Editor & Game Mods

Two companion desktop tools for **Crimson Desert**. They share a codebase and auto-updater plumbing, but each one does a narrow job well.

## The two builds

| Tool | What it does | Download |
|---|---|---|
| **Save Editor — Standalone** | Edits your local `.save` file: inventory, equipment, sockets (fill/clear up to 5), quests, knowledge, abyss gates, dye. | [Releases → `standalone-v1.0.0`](../../releases/tag/standalone-v1.0.0) |
| **Game Mods** | Edits the game's `.pabgb` data via PAZ overlays: ItemBuffs, Stores, DropSets, SpawnEdit, FieldEdit (mount-everywhere, killable NPCs, etc.). | [Releases → `gamemods-v1.0.0`](../../releases/tag/gamemods-v1.0.0) |

**Install both** if you want the full experience — they run independently, don't clobber each other's config/backups, and auto-update separately via their own version manifests.

Neither tool modifies the game client in memory. Save Editor writes to your encrypted `save.save` file; Game Mods writes to PAZ overlay directories.

## Save Editor (Standalone) — highlights

- **Inventory / Equipment** — stack counts, enchants, endurance, sharpness, duplicate gear, swap items via 2,000+ real game templates.
- **Sockets** — swap gems, **fill empty sockets**, **clear gems** (v3.2.0 port — up to 5 sockets on unsocketed items).
- **Quest Editor** — advance/reset/complete quests, diagnose corruption, batch complete filtered.
- **Knowledge / Abyss Gates** — mark as discovered, unlock puzzle states.
- **Dye** — edit RGB, material, grime on any previously-dyed item.
- **Repurchase (Vendor Swap)** — the safest swap method: sell junk, edit, buy back.
- **Backup/Restore** — auto-backup before every write; pristine backup support.
- **Auto-find saves** — Steam, Epic, Game Pass, Linux Proton.

Full feature list in the release notes.

## Game Mods — highlights

- **ItemBuffs** — inject stats/buffs/enchants into `iteminfo.pabgb`. 28 stat hashes, presets from dev rings, optional in-game inventory lookup.
- **Stores** — edit vendor **prices, limits, stock** (in-table editable). 254 vendors.
- **DropSets** — modify drop rates, quantities, item keys on `dropsetinfo.pabgb`.
- **SpawnEdit** — tweak creature / NPC / faction spawn counts and cooldowns across 6+ spawn tables.
- **FieldEdit** — unified vehicle / region / mount / gimmick editor. Enable mounts in towns, extend ride duration, make NPCs killable, etc.
- **Items → Database** — readonly item reference.
- **Export as CDUMM Mod** — ItemBuffs + SpawnEdit can produce mod packages importable by the CDUMM Mod Manager.

## How to use

1. Download the tool you want from [Releases](../../releases).
2. Put the `.exe` in a folder of its own — it'll write config / backups next to itself.
3. Run it. Use the in-app **Guides** menu for per-tab walkthroughs.
4. For Game Mods, point the Game Path bar at your Crimson Desert install (auto-detect tries first).

## Build from source

The standalone save editor is verified with 64-bit Python 3.12 in an isolated
virtual environment:

```powershell
py -3.12 -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pip install -r CrimsonSaveEditor\requirements-dev.txt
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pytest tests -v --timeout=600
Push-Location CrimsonSaveEditor
..\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m PyInstaller CrimsonSaveEditor.spec --noconfirm --clean
Pop-Location
```

Output: `CrimsonSaveEditor\dist\CrimsonSaveEditorStandalone.exe`.

See [BUILD_FROM_SOURCE.md](BUILD_FROM_SOURCE.md) for the exact Windows
dependency list, copied-fixture dry-run, native runtime requirement, optional
`crimson_rs` limitation, packaged files, and Game Mods notes.
